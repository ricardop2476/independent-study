# Entry 6: MVP

## Lets See An Example
Now that I have a decent amount of knowledge of reactJS it is time to start thinking/planing about what I will build with this JavaScript library. One issue that I have at the moment is that I have done the codecademy course and have used many resourecs on the internet (such as YouTube videos and other websites that have reactJS documentation) I have yet to see an example of reactJS put into use. I know how components of this library work, however I have not seen this in action. I went on the official website of reactJS and found out that they have examples of work that people have created. One that I found most interesting and that might be somewhat similar to my final project was this:
